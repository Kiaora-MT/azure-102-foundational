# FortiGate: Protecting Azure vNET Traffic Flows

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this workshop, you will gain understanding of the following objectives:
  * Azure Networking Concepts
  * Azure Architecture Concepts
  * FortiGate FortiOS terminology
  * Creating & applying Firewall policies with security profiles & objects to control traffic flows
  * Testing traffic flows to validate the implemented networking and security controls

<!--
## Workshop Components

Fortinet & Azure compute and components used during this workshop:

  * Azure Fsv2 series instances running a FortiGate NVA
  * Azure DsV4 series instances running Ubuntu Linux OS as the testing workloads
  * Azure Networking Components:
    * Virtual Network (vNET)
    * Subnets
    * NAT Gateway
    * User-defined Route Table (UDR)
-->

## Azure Reference Architecture Diagram

  * Azure networking offers multiple ways to organize your Azure architecture to take advantage of FortiGate traffic inspection.  Most importantly, traffic must follow a symmetrical routing path (for forward and reverse flows). As long as flows are symmetrical, the architecture will work and traffic will flow through a FortiGate NGFW for inspection.

  * We will deploy and configure the following two architectures:
    - **Traffic flows in a single VNET without a FortiGate NVA - Unsecured VNET**
